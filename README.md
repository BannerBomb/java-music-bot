# DEAR PEOPLE LOOKING TO SELF HOST
Please don't. This bot is not build with self hosting in mind and has been written entirely for dabBot's use only. 
**SUPPORT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED FOR THIS REPOSITORY**.

## Alternatives for self hosting
[jagrosh](https://github.com/jagrosh) makes an excellent java discord music bot built for the purpose of self hosting.
It has every feature needed for running a music bot for your discord server and none of the massive bloat included in 
dabBot! Support is also provided for self hosting it & there is a very comprehensive setup guide.

Please use [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot) instead of this repository.

## Why the fuck did you put it on GitHub then?
Because I like version control, open sourcing my code as it builds my portfolio, makes it easier for other developers 
to contribute and hopefully helps people learn from my code.

## Note to previous self hosters
Support has been 100% cut from this project. Hosting now requires lavalink sending nodes & other external dependencies.
